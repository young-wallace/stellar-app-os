# 🌱 Harvesta — Plant Trees. Track Impact. Offset Carbon.

> A decentralised tree-planting platform on Stellar where anyone can pay farmers and individuals to plant trees — anonymously or with full carbon-offset tracking — and planters upload real-world progress with a unique tree ID.
> 
> *Proudly supported by [Fundable Finance](https://fundable.finance).*

## What is Harvesta?

Harvesta connects **tree sponsors** with **on-the-ground planters** (farmers, community groups, individuals) through a transparent, blockchain-backed payment system built on **Stellar** using **Soroban** smart contracts.

You can:

- **Sponsor a tree** — pay a planter to plant and care for a tree on your behalf.
- **Go anonymous** — make a one-time donation with no account required.
- **Track your forest** — create an account, get a unique tree ID for every tree you sponsor, and follow its growth through planter-uploaded photo and GPS updates.
- **Measure your impact** — the platform calculates estimated CO₂ offset per tree species and shows your cumulative carbon footprint reduction.

Planters receive **instant Stellar payments** the moment a tree is verified, with no banks, no delays, and no middlemen.

## How It Works

  │                              │── Release payment ──────>│
```

1. **Sponsor** selects tree species, quantity, region, and payment method (XLM or USDC).
2. **Smart contract** holds funds in escrow, mints a unique Tree NFT ID.
3. **Planter** receives the job, plants the tree, and uploads timestamped photo + GPS proof.
4. **Contract** releases payment to planter upon verification.
5. **Sponsor dashboard** shows live tree progress, species info, and CO₂ offset estimate.

## Project Architecture

> 📖 **Full System Architecture**: See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level architecture diagram and data flows across smart contracts, frontend, backend, and IPFS.

This project follows the **atomic design pattern**. Components are organized by complexity, not by feature.

### Design Hierarchy

| Level         | Purpose                          | Example                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Atoms**     | Single-purpose UI elements       | `Button`, `Input`, `Text`, `Badge`      |
| **Molecules** | Groups of atoms working together | `Card`, `FormField`                     |
| **Organisms** | Complex UI sections              | `Header`, `DonationForm`, `ProjectGrid` |
| **Templates** | Page-level structural layouts    | `DashboardLayout`, `AuthLayout`         |

### Stellar Color Tokens

These brand colors are defined in `app/globals.css` and available as Tailwind classes:

| Token          | Value     | Tailwind Class                             |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Stellar Blue   | `#14B6E7` | `bg-stellar-blue`, `text-stellar-blue`     |
| Stellar Purple | `#3E1BDB` | `bg-stellar-purple`, `text-stellar-purple` |
| Stellar Navy   | `#0D0B21` | `bg-stellar-navy`, `text-stellar-navy`     |
| Stellar Cyan   | `#00C2FF` | `bg-stellar-cyan`, `text-stellar-cyan`     |
| Stellar Green  | `#00B36B` | `bg-stellar-green`, `text-stellar-green`   |

### Import Convention

**No barrel exports.** Always import directly from the component file:

```tsx
// Correct
import { Button } from '@/components/atoms/Button';
import { Card, CardHeader } from '@/components/molecules/Card';

// Wrong — do not use index.ts barrel exports
import { Button } from '@/components/atoms';
```

## Contributing

### 1. Pick an Issue

Browse [open issues](https://github.com/Farm-credit/stellar-app-os/issues) labeled `Stellar Wave`. Comment on the issue to claim it. Do not work on an issue someone else has claimed without coordinating.

### 2. Branch from `main`

Always start from the latest `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

Branch naming examples:

- `feat/42-wallet-connect-modal`
- `fix/78-rate-limit-toast`
- `docs/107-contributing-guide`

### 3. Coding Standards

- **TypeScript strict mode** — no `any`, no unused variables
- **Component patterns** — use `forwardRef` where needed, always set `displayName`, export named types
- **Naming** — PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables, kebab-case for CSS classes
- **Atomic design** — atoms extend `ui/` base components with Stellar variants; molecules compose atoms
- **No barrel exports** — import directly from the file, not from `index.ts`

### 4. Commit Conventions

This project enforces **Conventional Commits** and **atomic commits**.

#### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

#### Allowed Types

| Type       | When to use                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature or component               |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                     |
| `style`    | Formatting, no logic change            |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change |

#### Allowed Scopes

`auth`, `wallet`, `dashboard`, `marketplace`, `admin`, `donation`, `carbon`, `ui`, `layout`, `nav`, `config`, `deps`

#### Examples

```bash
feat(wallet): add Stellar wallet connection modal
fix(donation): correct minimum amount validation
docs(contributing): add commit convention section
style(ui): format Button component with Prettier
refactor(dashboard): extract tab components into separate files
```

#### Atomic Commit Rules

1. **One concern per commit** — never mix a bug fix with a new feature
2. **Each commit must build** — `pnpm build` must pass at every single commit
3. **Each commit must be revertable** — reverting one commit must not break unrelated code
4. **Order matters** — foundation first, then features, then polish

**Bad example** (one giant commit):

```
feat: add dashboard with tabs, fix header bug, update colors
```

**Good example** (atomic):

```
feat(dashboard): create dashboard page layout
feat(dashboard): add overview tab component
feat(dashboard): add donations tab component
fix(nav): correct active link highlighting on dashboard
style(dashboard): align tab content padding
```

### 5. Pull Request Process

```bash
# Make sure you're up to date with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <your-branch>
git rebase main

# Verify everything passes
pnpm build
pnpm lint
```

#### PR Requirements

Every PR **must** include:

- **Linked issue** — use `Closes #<issue-number>` in the PR description
- **Screen recording** — record your implementation working in the browser and attach it to the PR
- **Filled PR template** — Summary, What Was Implemented, Implementation Details, How to Test

## 🔒 Redis Redlock – Wallet Transaction Serialization

To prevent **Stellar sequence/nonce collisions** when multiple API replicas build transactions for the same wallet concurrently, the backend uses **Redis Redlock** distributed locks.

### Problem

Stellar accounts use a strict sequence number (similar to Ethereum nonce). If two concurrent requests load the same sequence and both build `seq+1`, one will fail with `tx_bad_seq`.

```
Client A: loadAccount seq=100 ─┐
Client B: loadAccount seq=100 ─┼─► both build seq=101 ─► one fails tx_bad_seq
```

### Solution – Redlock per Wallet

All transaction building API routes now acquire a distributed lock keyed by wallet public key:

```ts
import { withWalletLock } from '@/lib/cache/redlock';

const result = await withWalletLock(walletPublicKey, async () => {
  return buildDonationTransaction(...);
});
```

Lock keys:
- `lock:wallet:tx:{publicKey}` – transaction building / submission
- `lock:wallet:nonce:{publicKey}` – auth nonce generation
- `auth:nonce:{publicKey}` – single-use login nonces stored in Redis

### Implementation

- **lib/cache/redis.ts** – singleton Redis client manager (supports `REDIS_URL` and `REDIS_URLS` for multi-instance Redlock quorum)
- **lib/cache/redlock.ts** – full Redlock algorithm:
  - `SET key value NX PX ttl` with unique token
  - Quorum = `floor(n/2)+1`
  - Validity = `ttl - elapsed - drift`
  - Lua unlock: `if get == token then del`
  - Retry with jitter
  - **In-memory fallback** when `REDIS_URL` not set (single-process serialization via promise queues + TTL)
- **lib/auth/nonce.ts** – Redis-backed single-use nonce store with atomic Lua consume
- **API routes** (`/api/transaction/build`, `/build-donation`, `/credits/bulk-purchase`, `/transaction/build-anonymous-donation`, `/nft/mint`, `/transaction/submit`) – wrapped with `withWalletLock`

### Environment Variables

```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
# Optional multi-instance for true Redlock quorum
# REDIS_URLS=redis://127.0.0.1:6379,redis://127.0.0.1:6380,redis://127.0.0.1:6381

REDIS_LOCK_TTL_MS=10000
REDIS_LOCK_RETRY_COUNT=10
REDIS_LOCK_RETRY_DELAY_MS=100
REDIS_LOCK_RETRY_JITTER_MS=100
REDIS_LOCK_SIGNING_TTL_MS=30000
REDIS_LOCK_SIGNING_RETRY=20
```

If `REDIS_URL` is not set, the system logs a warning and falls back to in-memory locks – safe for local dev but not distributed.

### Testing

```bash
pnpm test lib/cache/__tests__/redlock.test.ts
pnpm test lib/auth/__tests__/nonce-redlock.test.ts
pnpm test lib/cache/__tests__/wallet-lock-integration.test.ts
```

Tests verify:
- Lock acquire/release
- Serialization of same wallet, parallel for different wallets
- Auto-expiry and extend
- Failure after retries (throws `LockAcquisitionError` → API returns 409)
- Nonce single-use guarantee via Redis Lua

### Security & Scalability

- Unique token per lock prevents accidental release by other workers
- TTL prevents deadlocks if holder crashes
- Retry with jitter avoids thundering herd
- Logs via Winston with redaction of sensitive keys
- Quorum-based multi-Redis support for production HA


# 🌱 Harvesta — Plant Trees. Track Impact. Offset Carbon.

> A decentralised tree-planting platform on Stellar where anyone can pay farmers and individuals to plant trees — anonymously or with full carbon-offset tracking — and planters upload real-world progress with a unique tree ID.
> 
> *Proudly supported by [Fundable Finance](https://fundable.finance).*

---

## What is Harvesta?

Harvesta connects **tree sponsors** with **on-the-ground planters** (farmers, community groups, individuals) through a transparent, blockchain-backed payment system built on **Stellar** using **Soroban** smart contracts.

You can:

- **Sponsor a tree** — pay a planter to plant and care for a tree on your behalf.
- **Go anonymous** — make a one-time donation with no account required.
- **Track your forest** — create an account, get a unique tree ID for every tree you sponsor, and follow its growth through planter-uploaded photo and GPS updates.
- **Measure your impact** — the platform calculates estimated CO₂ offset per tree species and shows your cumulative carbon footprint reduction.

Planters receive **instant Stellar payments** the moment a tree is verified, with no banks, no delays, and no middlemen.

---

## How It Works

```

```

1. **Sponsor** selects tree species, quantity, region, and payment method (XLM or USDC).
2. **Smart contract** holds funds in escrow, mints a unique Tree NFT ID.
3. **Planter** receives the job, plants the tree, and uploads timestamped photo + GPS proof.
4. **Contract** releases payment to planter upon verification.
5. **Sponsor dashboard** shows live tree progress, species info, and CO₂ offset estimate.

### Design Hierarchy

| Level         | Purpose                          | Example                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Atoms**     | Single-purpose UI elements       | `Button`, `Input`, `Text`, `Badge`      |
| **Molecules** | Groups of atoms working together | `Card`, `FormField`                     |
| **Organisms** | Complex UI sections              | `Header`, `DonationForm`, `ProjectGrid` |
| **Templates** | Page-level structural layouts    | `DashboardLayout`, `AuthLayout`         |

### Stellar Color Tokens

These brand colors are defined in `app/globals.css` and available as Tailwind classes:

| Token          | Value     | Tailwind Class                             |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Stellar Blue   | `#14B6E7` | `bg-stellar-blue`, `text-stellar-blue`     |
| Stellar Purple | `#3E1BDB` | `bg-stellar-purple`, `text-stellar-purple` |
| Stellar Navy   | `#0D0B21` | `bg-stellar-navy`, `text-stellar-navy`     |
| Stellar Cyan   | `#00C2FF` | `bg-stellar-cyan`, `text-stellar-cyan`     |
| Stellar Green  | `#00B36B` | `bg-stellar-green`, `text-stellar-green`   |

### Import Convention

**No barrel exports.** Always import directly from the component file:

```tsx
// Correct
import { Button } from '@/components/atoms/Button';
import { Card, CardHeader } from '@/components/molecules/Card';

// Wrong — do not use index.ts barrel exports
import { Button } from '@/components/atoms';
```

## Contributing

### 1. Pick an Issue

Browse [open issues](https://github.com/Farm-credit/stellar-app-os/issues) labeled `Stellar Wave`. Comment on the issue to claim it. Do not work on an issue someone else has claimed without coordinating.

### 2. Branch from `main`

Always start from the latest `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

Branch naming examples:

- `feat/42-wallet-connect-modal`
- `fix/78-rate-limit-toast`
- `docs/107-contributing-guide`

### 3. Coding Standards

- **TypeScript strict mode** — no `any`, no unused variables
- **Component patterns** — use `forwardRef` where needed, always set `displayName`, export named types
- **Naming** — PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables, kebab-case for CSS classes
- **Atomic design** — atoms extend `ui/` base components with Stellar variants; molecules compose atoms
- **No barrel exports** — import directly from the file, not from `index.ts`

### 4. Commit Conventions

This project enforces **Conventional Commits** and **atomic commits**.

#### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

#### Allowed Types

| Type       | When to use                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature or component               |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                     |
| `style`    | Formatting, no logic change            |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests               |
| `build`    | Build system or dependency changes     |
| `ci`       | CI configuration changes               |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks                      |

#### Allowed Scopes

`auth`, `wallet`, `dashboard`, `marketplace`, `admin`, `donation`, `carbon`, `ui`, `layout`, `nav`, `config`, `deps`

#### Examples

```bash
feat(wallet): add Stellar wallet connection modal
fix(donation): correct minimum amount validation
docs(contributing): add commit convention section
style(ui): format Button component with Prettier
refactor(dashboard): extract tab components into separate files
```

#### Atomic Commit Rules

1. **One concern per commit** — never mix a bug fix with a new feature
2. **Each commit must build** — `pnpm build` must pass at every single commit
3. **Each commit must be revertable** — reverting one commit must not break unrelated code
4. **Order matters** — foundation first, then features, then polish

**Bad example** (one giant commit):

```
feat: add dashboard with tabs, fix header bug, update colors
```

**Good example** (atomic):

```
feat(dashboard): create dashboard page layout
feat(dashboard): add overview tab component
feat(dashboard): add donations tab component
fix(nav): correct active link highlighting on dashboard
style(dashboard): align tab content padding
```

### 5. Pull Request Process

#### Before Submitting

```bash
# Make sure you're up to date with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <your-branch>
git rebase main

# Verify everything passes
pnpm build
pnpm lint
```

#### PR Requirements

Every PR **must** include:

- **Linked issue** — use `Closes #<issue-number>` in the PR description
- **Screen recording** — record your implementation working in the browser and attach it to the PR
- **Filled PR template** — Summary, What Was Implemented, Implementation Details, How to Test
- **Passing CI** — build and lint must pass

> **PRs without a screen recording or without a linked issue will not be reviewed.**

#### PR Template

When you open a PR, the template will auto-populate. Fill out every section:

```markdown
## Summary

<!-- 1-3 sentences: What does this PR do and why? -->

## Related Issue

Closes #<issue-number>

## What Was Implemented

<!-- Detailed list of what was built/changed -->

- [ ] Component X created
- [ ] Styling applied with Stellar tokens
- [ ] Responsive on mobile

## Implementation Details

<!-- Key decisions, patterns used, trade-offs -->

## Screenshots / Recordings

<!-- REQUIRED: Screen recording of your implementation -->

## How to Test

<!-- Step-by-step for reviewers -->

1. Checkout this branch
2. Run `pnpm dev`
3. Navigate to /path
4. Verify X works
```

### 6. Code Review

- Expect feedback. Reviews are about improving the code, not criticizing the author.
- Respond to every comment — either make the change or explain why not.
- After addressing feedback, re-request review.
- Maintainers will merge once approved and CI passes.

### 7. Stay in Sync

While your PR is in review, keep your branch up to date:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <your-branch>
git rebase main
git push --force-with-lease
```

## Horizon RPC Node Health Monitoring & Fallback Switcher

Monitors latency and health of multiple Stellar Horizon RPC nodes, dynamically routing requests to the fastest healthy node.

### Configuration

Set these environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `RPC_NODE_URLS` | Comma-separated Horizon URLs | falls back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL` |
| `RPC_NODE_NAMES` | Optional node labels | `node-0`, `node-1`, ... |
| `RPC_NODE_WEIGHTS` | Reserved for weighted routing | `1` each |
| `RPC_PING_TIMEOUT_MS` | Per-node ping timeout | `5000` |
| `RPC_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` | Failures before marking unhealthy | `3` |
| `RPC_MONITOR_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | Worker check interval | `30000` |

### Architecture

- **`lib/monitor/rpc-health.ts`** — `RpcHealthMonitor` class pings each node via `HEAD /`, tracks latency and consecutive failures, and returns the best (lowest-latency healthy) node
- **`lib/monitor/rpc-monitor-worker.ts`** — Long-running background process (`pnpm monitor:rpc-nodes`) that periodically runs checks and logs node status
- **`app/api/healthz/route.ts`** — Deep health endpoint checks all configured RPC nodes and reports per-node health + best node in the response

### Usage in Stellar Clients

```typescript
import { RpcHealthMonitor } from '@/lib/monitor/rpc-health';

const monitor = new RpcHealthMonitor();
await monitor.checkAll();
const bestUrl = monitor.getBestUrl(); // e.g. "https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org"
const server = new Horizon.Server(bestUrl);
```

### Background Worker

```bash
pnpm monitor:rpc-nodes
```

Logs healthy/unhealthy node status every `RPC_MONITOR_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`.

## Project Architecture

This project follows the **atomic design pattern**. Components are organized by complexity, not by feature.

### Design Hierarchy

| Level         | Purpose                          | Example                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Atoms**     | Single-purpose UI elements       | `Button`, `Input`, `Text`, `Badge`      |
| **Molecules** | Groups of atoms working together | `Card`, `FormField`                     |
| **Organisms** | Complex UI sections              | `Header`, `DonationForm`, `ProjectGrid` |
| **Templates** | Page-level structural layouts    | `DashboardLayout`, `AuthLayout`         |

### Stellar Color Tokens

These brand colors are defined in `app/globals.css` and available as Tailwind classes:

| Token          | Value     | Tailwind Class                             |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Stellar Blue   | `#14B6E7` | `bg-stellar-blue`, `text-stellar-blue`     |
| Stellar Purple | `#3E1BDB` | `bg-stellar-purple`, `text-stellar-purple` |
| Stellar Navy   | `#0D0B21` | `bg-stellar-navy`, `text-stellar-navy`     |
| Stellar Cyan   | `#00C2FF` | `bg-stellar-cyan`, `text-stellar-cyan`     |
| Stellar Green  | `#00B36B` | `bg-stellar-green`, `text-stellar-green`   |

### Import Convention

**No barrel exports.** Always import directly from the component file:

```tsx
// Correct
import { Button } from '@/components/atoms/Button';
import { Card, CardHeader } from '@/components/molecules/Card';

// Wrong — do not use index.ts barrel exports
import { Button } from '@/components/atoms';
```

## Contributing

### 1. Pick an Issue

Browse [open issues](https://github.com/Farm-credit/stellar-app-os/issues) labeled `Stellar Wave`. Comment on the issue to claim it. Do not work on an issue someone else has claimed without coordinating.

### 2. Branch from `main`

Always start from the latest `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

Branch naming examples:

- `feat/42-wallet-connect-modal`
- `fix/78-rate-limit-toast`
- `docs/107-contributing-guide`

### 3. Coding Standards

- **TypeScript strict mode** — no `any`, no unused variables
- **Component patterns** — use `forwardRef` where needed, always set `displayName`, export named types
- **Naming** — PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables, kebab-case for CSS classes
- **Atomic design** — atoms extend `ui/` base components with Stellar variants; molecules compose atoms
- **No barrel exports** — import directly from the file, not from `index.ts`

### 4. Commit Conventions

This project enforces **Conventional Commits** and **atomic commits**.

#### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

#### Allowed Types

| Type       | When to use                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature or component               |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                     |
| `style`    | Formatting, no logic change            |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests               |
| `build`    | Build system or dependency changes     |
| `ci`       | CI configuration changes               |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks                      |

#### Allowed Scopes

`auth`, `wallet`, `dashboard`, `marketplace`, `admin`, `donation`, `carbon`, `ui`, `layout`, `nav`, `config`, `deps`

#### Examples

```bash
feat(wallet): add Stellar wallet connection modal
fix(donation): correct minimum amount validation
docs(contributing): add commit convention section
style(ui): format Button component with Prettier
refactor(dashboard): extract tab components into separate files
```

#### Atomic Commit Rules

1. **One concern per commit** — never mix a bug fix with a new feature
2. **Each commit must build** — `pnpm build` must pass at every single commit
3. **Each commit must be revertable** — reverting one commit must not break unrelated code
4. **Order matters** — foundation first, then features, then polish

**Bad example** (one giant commit):

```
feat: add dashboard with tabs, fix header bug, update colors
```

**Good example** (atomic):

```
feat(dashboard): create dashboard page layout
feat(dashboard): add overview tab component
feat(dashboard): add donations tab component
fix(nav): correct active link highlighting on dashboard
style(dashboard): align tab content padding
```

### 5. Pull Request Process

#### Before Submitting

```bash
# Make sure you're up to date with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <your-branch>
git rebase main

# Verify everything passes
pnpm build
pnpm lint
```

#### PR Requirements

Every PR **must** include:

- **Linked issue** — use `Closes #<issue-number>` in the PR description
- **Screen recording** — record your implementation working in the browser and attach it to the PR
- **Filled PR template** — Summary, What Was Implemented, Implementation Details, How to Test
- **Passing CI** — build and lint must pass

> **PRs without a screen recording or without a linked issue will not be reviewed.**

#### PR Template

When you open a PR, the template will auto-populate. Fill out every section:

```markdown
## Summary

<!-- 1-3 sentences: What does this PR do and why? -->

## Related Issue

Closes #<issue-number>

## What Was Implemented

<!-- Detailed list of what was built/changed -->

- [ ] Component X created
- [ ] Styling applied with Stellar tokens
- [ ] Responsive on mobile

## Implementation Details

<!-- Key decisions, patterns used, trade-offs -->

## Screenshots / Recordings

<!-- REQUIRED: Screen recording of your implementation -->

## How to Test

<!-- Step-by-step for reviewers -->

1. Checkout this branch
2. Run `pnpm dev`
3. Navigate to /path
4. Verify X works
```

### 6. Code Review

- Expect feedback. Reviews are about improving the code, not criticizing the author.
- Respond to every comment — either make the change or explain why not.
- After addressing feedback, re-request review.
- Maintainers will merge once approved and CI passes.

### 7. Stay in Sync

While your PR is in review, keep your branch up to date:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <your-branch>
git rebase main
git push --force-with-lease
```

# 🌱 Harvesta — Plant Trees. Track Impact. Offset Carbon.

> A decentralised tree-planting platform on Stellar where anyone can pay farmers and individuals to plant trees — anonymously or with full carbon-offset tracking — and planters upload real-world progress with a unique tree ID.

---

## What is Harvesta?

Harvesta connects **tree sponsors** with **on-the-ground planters** (farmers, community groups, individuals) through a transparent, blockchain-backed payment system built on **Stellar** using **Soroban** smart contracts.

You can:

- **Sponsor a tree** — pay a planter to plant and care for a tree on your behalf.
- **Go anonymous** — make a one-time donation with no account required.
- **Track your forest** — create an account, get a unique tree ID for every tree you sponsor, and follow its growth through planter-uploaded photo and GPS updates.
- **Measure your impact** — the platform calculates estimated CO₂ offset per tree species and shows your cumulative carbon footprint reduction.

Planters receive **instant Stellar payments** the moment a tree is verified, with no banks, no delays, and no middlemen.

1. **Sponsor** selects tree species, quantity, region, and payment method (XLM or USDC).
2. **Smart contract** holds funds in escrow, mints a unique Tree NFT ID.
3. **Planter** receives the job, plants the tree, and uploads timestamped photo + GPS proof.
4. **Contract** releases payment to planter upon verification.
5. **Sponsor dashboard** shows live tree progress, species info, and CO₂ offset estimate.

## Carbon Offset Methodology

Harvesta uses published biomass growth tables (FAO / IPCC Tier 1) to estimate CO₂ sequestration per tree species per year. Estimates are clearly labelled as projections and updated annually.

Example:

| Species | Avg CO₂/year (kg) | Maturity |
|---|---|---|
| Teak | 22 kg | 20 years |
| Moringa | 9 kg | 3 years |
| Eucalyptus | 31 kg | 10 years |
| Mangrove | 14 kg | 15 years |

---

## For Planters

1. Register your wallet and identity on-chain.
2. Browse open planting jobs in your region.
3. Accept a job — funds are locked in escrow immediately.
4. Plant the tree and upload photo + GPS coordinates using the mobile-friendly uploader.
5. Receive payment to your Stellar wallet instantly upon verification.

## Project Architecture

This project follows the **atomic design pattern**. Components are organized by complexity, not by feature.

```

├── app/                    # Next.js App Router pages & layouts
│   ├── globals.css         # Stellar color tokens + Tailwind config

### Design Hierarchy

| Level         | Purpose                          | Example                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Atoms**     | Single-purpose UI elements       | `Button`, `Input`, `Text`, `Badge`      |
| **Molecules** | Groups of atoms working together | `Card`, `FormField`                     |
| **Organisms** | Complex UI sections              | `Header`, `DonationForm`, `ProjectGrid` |
| **Templates** | Page-level structural layouts    | `DashboardLayout`, `AuthLayout`         |

### Stellar Color Tokens

These brand colors are defined in `app/globals.css` and available as Tailwind classes:

| Token          | Value     | Tailwind Class                             |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Stellar Blue   | `#14B6E7` | `bg-stellar-blue`, `text-stellar-blue`     |
| Stellar Purple | `#3E1BDB` | `bg-stellar-purple`, `text-stellar-purple` |
| Stellar Navy   | `#0D0B21` | `bg-stellar-navy`, `text-stellar-navy`     |
| Stellar Cyan   | `#00C2FF` | `bg-stellar-cyan`, `text-stellar-cyan`     |
| Stellar Green  | `#00B36B` | `bg-stellar-green`, `text-stellar-green`   |

### Import Convention

**No barrel exports.** Always import directly from the component file:

```tsx
// Correct
import { Button } from '@/components/atoms/Button';
import { Card, CardHeader } from '@/components/molecules/Card';

// Wrong — do not use index.ts barrel exports
import { Button } from '@/components/atoms';
```

## Contributing

### 1. Pick an Issue

Browse [open issues](https://github.com/Farm-credit/stellar-app-os/issues) labeled `Stellar Wave`. Comment on the issue to claim it. Do not work on an issue someone else has claimed without coordinating.

### 2. Branch from `main`

Always start from the latest `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

Branch naming examples:

- `feat/42-wallet-connect-modal`
- `fix/78-rate-limit-toast`
- `docs/107-contributing-guide`

### 3. Coding Standards

- **TypeScript strict mode** — no `any`, no unused variables
- **Component patterns** — use `forwardRef` where needed, always set `displayName`, export named types
- **Naming** — PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables, kebab-case for CSS classes
- **Atomic design** — atoms extend `ui/` base components with Stellar variants; molecules compose atoms
- **No barrel exports** — import directly from the file, not from `index.ts`

### 4. Commit Conventions

This project enforces **Conventional Commits** and **atomic commits**.

#### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

#### Allowed Types

| Type       | When to use                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature or component               |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                     |
| `style`    | Formatting, no logic change            |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests               |
| `build`    | Build system or dependency changes     |
| `ci`       | CI configuration changes               |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks                      |

#### Allowed Scopes

`auth`, `wallet`, `dashboard`, `marketplace`, `admin`, `donation`, `carbon`, `ui`, `layout`, `nav`, `config`, `deps`

#### Examples

```bash
feat(wallet): add Stellar wallet connection modal
fix(donation): correct minimum amount validation
docs(contributing): add commit convention section
style(ui): format Button component with Prettier
refactor(dashboard): extract tab components into separate files
```

#### Atomic Commit Rules

1. **One concern per commit** — never mix a bug fix with a new feature
2. **Each commit must build** — `pnpm build` must pass at every single commit
3. **Each commit must be revertable** — reverting one commit must not break unrelated code
4. **Order matters** — foundation first, then features, then polish

**Bad example** (one giant commit):

```
feat: add dashboard with tabs, fix header bug, update colors
```

**Good example** (atomic):

```
feat(dashboard): create dashboard page layout
feat(dashboard): add overview tab component
feat(dashboard): add donations tab component
fix(nav): correct active link highlighting on dashboard
style(dashboard): align tab content padding
```

### 5. Pull Request Process

#### Before Submitting

```bash
# Make sure you're up to date with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <your-branch>
git rebase main

# Verify everything passes
pnpm build
pnpm lint
```

#### PR Requirements

Every PR **must** include:

- **Linked issue** — use `Closes #<issue-number>` in the PR description
- **Screen recording** — record your implementation working in the browser and attach it to the PR
- **Filled PR template** — Summary, What Was Implemented, Implementation Details, How to Test
- **Passing CI** — build and lint must pass

> **PRs without a screen recording or without a linked issue will not be reviewed.**

#### PR Template

When you open a PR, the template will auto-populate. Fill out every section:

```markdown
## Summary

<!-- 1-3 sentences: What does this PR do and why? -->

## Related Issue

Closes #<issue-number>

## What Was Implemented

<!-- Detailed list of what was built/changed -->

- [ ] Component X created
- [ ] Styling applied with Stellar tokens
- [ ] Responsive on mobile

## Implementation Details

<!-- Key decisions, patterns used, trade-offs -->

## Screenshots / Recordings

<!-- REQUIRED: Screen recording of your implementation -->

## How to Test

<!-- Step-by-step for reviewers -->

1. Checkout this branch
2. Run `pnpm dev`
3. Navigate to /path
4. Verify X works
```

### 6. Code Review

- Expect feedback. Reviews are about improving the code, not criticizing the author.
- Respond to every comment — either make the change or explain why not.
- After addressing feedback, re-request review.
- Maintainers will merge once approved and CI passes.

### 7. Stay in Sync

While your PR is in review, keep your branch up to date:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <your-branch>
git rebase main
git push --force-with-lease
```

# 🌱 Harvesta — Plant Trees. Track Impact. Offset Carbon.

> A decentralised tree-planting platform on Stellar where anyone can pay farmers and individuals to plant trees — anonymously or with full carbon-offset tracking — and planters upload real-world progress with a unique tree ID.

---

## What is Harvesta?

Harvesta connects **tree sponsors** with **on-the-ground planters** (farmers, community groups, individuals) through a transparent, blockchain-backed payment system built on **Stellar** using **Soroban** smart contracts.

You can:

- **Sponsor a tree** — pay a planter to plant and care for a tree on your behalf.
- **Go anonymous** — make a one-time donation with no account required.
- **Track your forest** — create an account, get a unique tree ID for every tree you sponsor, and follow its growth through planter-uploaded photo and GPS updates.
- **Measure your impact** — the platform calculates estimated CO₂ offset per tree species and shows your cumulative carbon footprint reduction.

Planters receive **instant Stellar payments** the moment a tree is verified, with no banks, no delays, and no middlemen.

---

## Carbon Offset Methodology

Harvesta uses published biomass growth tables (FAO / IPCC Tier 1) to estimate CO₂ sequestration per tree species per year. Estimates are clearly labelled as projections and updated annually.

Example:

| Species | Avg CO₂/year (kg) | Maturity |
|---|---|---|
| Teak | 22 kg | 20 years |
| Moringa | 9 kg | 3 years |
| Eucalyptus | 31 kg | 10 years |
| Mangrove | 14 kg | 15 years |

---

## For Planters

1. Register your wallet and identity on-chain.
2. Browse open planting jobs in your region.
3. Accept a job — funds are locked in escrow immediately.
4. Plant the tree and upload photo + GPS coordinates using the mobile-friendly uploader.
5. Receive payment to your Stellar wallet instantly upon verification.

## Horizon RPC Node Health Monitoring & Fallback Switcher

Monitors latency and health of multiple Stellar Horizon RPC nodes, dynamically routing requests to the fastest healthy node.

### Configuration

Set these environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `RPC_NODE_URLS` | Comma-separated Horizon URLs | falls back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL` |
| `RPC_NODE_NAMES` | Optional node labels | `node-0`, `node-1`, ... |
| `RPC_NODE_WEIGHTS` | Reserved for weighted routing | `1` each |
| `RPC_PING_TIMEOUT_MS` | Per-node ping timeout | `5000` |
| `RPC_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` | Failures before marking unhealthy | `3` |
| `RPC_MONITOR_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | Worker check interval | `30000` |

### Architecture

- **`lib/monitor/rpc-health.ts`** — `RpcHealthMonitor` class pings each node via `HEAD /`, tracks latency and consecutive failures, and returns the best (lowest-latency healthy) node
- **`lib/monitor/rpc-monitor-worker.ts`** — Long-running background process (`pnpm monitor:rpc-nodes`) that periodically runs checks and logs node status
- **`app/api/healthz/route.ts`** — Deep health endpoint checks all configured RPC nodes and reports per-node health + best node in the response

### Usage in Stellar Clients

```typescript
import { RpcHealthMonitor } from '@/lib/monitor/rpc-health';

const monitor = new RpcHealthMonitor();
await monitor.checkAll();
const bestUrl = monitor.getBestUrl(); // e.g. "https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org"
const server = new Horizon.Server(bestUrl);
```

### Background Worker

```bash
pnpm monitor:rpc-nodes
```

Logs healthy/unhealthy node status every `RPC_MONITOR_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`.

## Project Architecture

This project follows the **atomic design pattern**. Components are organized by complexity, not by feature.

### Design Hierarchy

| Level         | Purpose                          | Example                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Atoms**     | Single-purpose UI elements       | `Button`, `Input`, `Text`, `Badge`      |
| **Molecules** | Groups of atoms working together | `Card`, `FormField`                     |
| **Organisms** | Complex UI sections              | `Header`, `DonationForm`, `ProjectGrid` |
| **Templates** | Page-level structural layouts    | `DashboardLayout`, `AuthLayout`         |

### Stellar Color Tokens

These brand colors are defined in `app/globals.css` and available as Tailwind classes:

| Token          | Value     | Tailwind Class                             |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Stellar Blue   | `#14B6E7` | `bg-stellar-blue`, `text-stellar-blue`     |
| Stellar Purple | `#3E1BDB` | `bg-stellar-purple`, `text-stellar-purple` |
| Stellar Navy   | `#0D0B21` | `bg-stellar-navy`, `text-stellar-navy`     |
| Stellar Cyan   | `#00C2FF` | `bg-stellar-cyan`, `text-stellar-cyan`     |
| Stellar Green  | `#00B36B` | `bg-stellar-green`, `text-stellar-green`   |

### Import Convention

**No barrel exports.** Always import directly from the component file:

```tsx
// Correct
import { Button } from '@/components/atoms/Button';
import { Card, CardHeader } from '@/components/molecules/Card';

// Wrong — do not use index.ts barrel exports
import { Button } from '@/components/atoms';
```

## Contributing

### 1. Pick an Issue

Browse [open issues](https://github.com/Farm-credit/stellar-app-os/issues) labeled `Stellar Wave`. Comment on the issue to claim it. Do not work on an issue someone else has claimed without coordinating.

### 2. Branch from `main`

Always start from the latest `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

Branch naming examples:

- `feat/42-wallet-connect-modal`
- `fix/78-rate-limit-toast`
- `docs/107-contributing-guide`

### 3. Coding Standards

- **TypeScript strict mode** — no `any`, no unused variables
- **Component patterns** — use `forwardRef` where needed, always set `displayName`, export named types
- **Naming** — PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables, kebab-case for CSS classes
- **Atomic design** — atoms extend `ui/` base components with Stellar variants; molecules compose atoms
- **No barrel exports** — import directly from the file, not from `index.ts`

### 4. Commit Conventions

This project enforces **Conventional Commits** and **atomic commits**.

#### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

#### Allowed Types

| Type       | When to use                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature or component               |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                     |
| `style`    | Formatting, no logic change            |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests               |
| `build`    | Build system or dependency changes     |
| `ci`       | CI configuration changes               |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks                      |

#### Allowed Scopes

`auth`, `wallet`, `dashboard`, `marketplace`, `admin`, `donation`, `carbon`, `ui`, `layout`, `nav`, `config`, `deps`

#### Examples

```bash
feat(wallet): add Stellar wallet connection modal
fix(donation): correct minimum amount validation
docs(contributing): add commit convention section
style(ui): format Button component with Prettier
refactor(dashboard): extract tab components into separate files
```

#### Atomic Commit Rules

1. **One concern per commit** — never mix a bug fix with a new feature
2. **Each commit must build** — `pnpm build` must pass at every single commit
3. **Each commit must be revertable** — reverting one commit must not break unrelated code
4. **Order matters** — foundation first, then features, then polish

**Bad example** (one giant commit):

```
feat: add dashboard with tabs, fix header bug, update colors
```

**Good example** (atomic):

```
feat(dashboard): create dashboard page layout
feat(dashboard): add overview tab component
feat(dashboard): add donations tab component
fix(nav): correct active link highlighting on dashboard
style(dashboard): align tab content padding
```

### 5. Pull Request Process

#### Before Submitting

```bash
# Make sure you're up to date with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <your-branch>
git rebase main

# Verify everything passes
pnpm build
pnpm lint
```

#### PR Requirements

Every PR **must** include:

- **Linked issue** — use `Closes #<issue-number>` in the PR description
- **Screen recording** — record your implementation working in the browser and attach it to the PR
- **Filled PR template** — Summary, What Was Implemented, Implementation Details, How to Test
- **Passing CI** — build and lint must pass

> **PRs without a screen recording or without a linked issue will not be reviewed.**

#### PR Template

When you open a PR, the template will auto-populate. Fill out every section:

```markdown
## Summary

<!-- 1-3 sentences: What does this PR do and why? -->

## Related Issue

Closes #<issue-number>

## What Was Implemented

<!-- Detailed list of what was built/changed -->

- [ ] Component X created
- [ ] Styling applied with Stellar tokens
- [ ] Responsive on mobile

## Implementation Details

<!-- Key decisions, patterns used, trade-offs -->

## Screenshots / Recordings

<!-- REQUIRED: Screen recording of your implementation -->

## How to Test

<!-- Step-by-step for reviewers -->

1. Checkout this branch
2. Run `pnpm dev`
3. Navigate to /path
4. Verify X works
```

### 6. Code Review

- Expect feedback. Reviews are about improving the code, not criticizing the author.
- Respond to every comment — either make the change or explain why not.
- After addressing feedback, re-request review.
- Maintainers will merge once approved and CI passes.

### 7. Stay in Sync

While your PR is in review, keep your branch up to date:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <your-branch>
git rebase main
git push --force-with-lease
```

# 🌱 Harvesta — Plant Trees. Track Impact. Offset Carbon.

> A decentralised tree-planting platform on Stellar where anyone can pay farmers and individuals to plant trees — anonymously or with full carbon-offset tracking — and planters upload real-world progress with a unique tree ID.

---

## What is Harvesta?

Harvesta connects **tree sponsors** with **on-the-ground planters** (farmers, community groups, individuals) through a transparent, blockchain-backed payment system built on **Stellar** using **Soroban** smart contracts.

You can:

- **Sponsor a tree** — pay a planter to plant and care for a tree on your behalf.
- **Go anonymous** — make a one-time donation with no account required.
- **Track your forest** — create an account, get a unique tree ID for every tree you sponsor, and follow its growth through planter-uploaded photo and GPS updates.
- **Measure your impact** — the platform calculates estimated CO₂ offset per tree species and shows your cumulative carbon footprint reduction.

Planters receive **instant Stellar payments** the moment a tree is verified, with no banks, no delays, and no middlemen.

---

## How It Works

  │                              │── Release payment ──────>│
```

1. **Sponsor** selects tree species, quantity, region, and payment method (XLM or USDC).
2. **Smart contract** holds funds in escrow, mints a unique Tree NFT ID.
3. **Planter** receives the job, plants the tree, and uploads timestamped photo + GPS proof.
4. **Contract** releases payment to planter upon verification.
5. **Sponsor dashboard** shows live tree progress, species info, and CO₂ offset estimate.

## Project Architecture

This project follows the **atomic design pattern**. Components are organized by complexity, not by feature.

```

### Design Hierarchy

| Level         | Purpose                          | Example                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Atoms**     | Single-purpose UI elements       | `Button`, `Input`, `Text`, `Badge`      |
| **Molecules** | Groups of atoms working together | `Card`, `FormField`                     |
| **Organisms** | Complex UI sections              | `Header`, `DonationForm`, `ProjectGrid` |
| **Templates** | Page-level structural layouts    | `DashboardLayout`, `AuthLayout`         |

### Stellar Color Tokens

These brand colors are defined in `app/globals.css` and available as Tailwind classes:

| Token          | Value     | Tailwind Class                             |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Stellar Blue   | `#14B6E7` | `bg-stellar-blue`, `text-stellar-blue`     |
| Stellar Purple | `#3E1BDB` | `bg-stellar-purple`, `text-stellar-purple` |
| Stellar Navy   | `#0D0B21` | `bg-stellar-navy`, `text-stellar-navy`     |
| Stellar Cyan   | `#00C2FF` | `bg-stellar-cyan`, `text-stellar-cyan`     |
| Stellar Green  | `#00B36B` | `bg-stellar-green`, `text-stellar-green`   |

### Import Convention

**No barrel exports.** Always import directly from the component file:

```tsx
// Correct
import { Button } from '@/components/atoms/Button';
import { Card, CardHeader } from '@/components/molecules/Card';

// Wrong — do not use index.ts barrel exports
import { Button } from '@/components/atoms';
```

## Contributing

### 1. Pick an Issue

Browse [open issues](https://github.com/Farm-credit/stellar-app-os/issues) labeled `Stellar Wave`. Comment on the issue to claim it. Do not work on an issue someone else has claimed without coordinating.

### 2. Branch from `main`

Always start from the latest `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

Branch naming examples:

- `feat/42-wallet-connect-modal`
- `fix/78-rate-limit-toast`
- `docs/107-contributing-guide`

### 3. Coding Standards

- **TypeScript strict mode** — no `any`, no unused variables
- **Component patterns** — use `forwardRef` where needed, always set `displayName`, export named types
- **Naming** — PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables, kebab-case for CSS classes
- **Atomic design** — atoms extend `ui/` base components with Stellar variants; molecules compose atoms
- **No barrel exports** — import directly from the file, not from `index.ts`

### 4. Commit Conventions

This project enforces **Conventional Commits** and **atomic commits**.

#### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

#### Allowed Types

| Type       | When to use                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature or component               |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                     |
| `style`    | Formatting, no logic change            |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests               |
| `build`    | Build system or dependency changes     |
| `ci`       | CI configuration changes               |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks                      |

#### Allowed Scopes

`auth`, `wallet`, `dashboard`, `marketplace`, `admin`, `donation`, `carbon`, `ui`, `layout`, `nav`, `config`, `deps`

#### Examples

```bash
feat(wallet): add Stellar wallet connection modal
fix(donation): correct minimum amount validation
docs(contributing): add commit convention section
style(ui): format Button component with Prettier
refactor(dashboard): extract tab components into separate files
```

#### Atomic Commit Rules

1. **One concern per commit** — never mix a bug fix with a new feature
2. **Each commit must build** — `pnpm build` must pass at every single commit
3. **Each commit must be revertable** — reverting one commit must not break unrelated code
4. **Order matters** — foundation first, then features, then polish

**Bad example** (one giant commit):

```
feat: add dashboard with tabs, fix header bug, update colors
```

**Good example** (atomic):

```
feat(dashboard): create dashboard page layout
feat(dashboard): add overview tab component
feat(dashboard): add donations tab component
fix(nav): correct active link highlighting on dashboard
style(dashboard): align tab content padding
```

### 5. Pull Request Process

#### Before Submitting

```bash
# Make sure you're up to date with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <your-branch>
git rebase main

# Verify everything passes
pnpm build
pnpm lint
```

#### PR Requirements

Every PR **must** include:

- **Linked issue** — use `Closes #<issue-number>` in the PR description
- **Screen recording** — record your implementation working in the browser and attach it to the PR
- **Filled PR template** — Summary, What Was Implemented, Implementation Details, How to Test
- **Passing CI** — build and lint must pass

> **PRs without a screen recording or without a linked issue will not be reviewed.**

#### PR Template

When you open a PR, the template will auto-populate. Fill out every section:

```markdown
## Summary

<!-- 1-3 sentences: What does this PR do and why? -->

## Related Issue

Closes #<issue-number>

## What Was Implemented

<!-- Detailed list of what was built/changed -->

- [ ] Component X created
- [ ] Styling applied with Stellar tokens
- [ ] Responsive on mobile

## Implementation Details

<!-- Key decisions, patterns used, trade-offs -->

## Screenshots / Recordings

<!-- REQUIRED: Screen recording of your implementation -->

## How to Test

<!-- Step-by-step for reviewers -->

1. Checkout this branch
2. Run `pnpm dev`
3. Navigate to /path
4. Verify X works
```

### 6. Code Review

- Expect feedback. Reviews are about improving the code, not criticizing the author.
- Respond to every comment — either make the change or explain why not.
- After addressing feedback, re-request review.
- Maintainers will merge once approved and CI passes.

### 7. Stay in Sync

While your PR is in review, keep your branch up to date:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <your-branch>
git rebase main
git push --force-with-lease
```

# 🌱 Harvesta — Plant Trees. Track Impact. Offset Carbon.

> A decentralised tree-planting platform on Stellar where anyone can pay farmers and individuals to plant trees — anonymously or with full carbon-offset tracking — and planters upload real-world progress with a unique tree ID.

---

## What is Harvesta?

Harvesta connects **tree sponsors** with **on-the-ground planters** (farmers, community groups, individuals) through a transparent, blockchain-backed payment system built on **Stellar** using **Soroban** smart contracts.

You can:

- **Sponsor a tree** — pay a planter to plant and care for a tree on your behalf.
- **Go anonymous** — make a one-time donation with no account required.
- **Track your forest** — create an account, get a unique tree ID for every tree you sponsor, and follow its growth through planter-uploaded photo and GPS updates.
- **Measure your impact** — the platform calculates estimated CO₂ offset per tree species and shows your cumulative carbon footprint reduction.

Planters receive **instant Stellar payments** the moment a tree is verified, with no banks, no delays, and no middlemen.

---

## How It Works

```
Sponsor                   Harvesta Platform              Planter
  │                              │                          │

  │── Pay in XLM / USDC ────────>│                          │
  │                              │── Escrow in contract ───>│
  │                              │                          │── Plant tree
  │                              │                          │── Upload photo + GPS
  │                              │<── Progress update ──────│
  │<── Carbon dashboard update ──│                          │
  │                              │── Release payment ──────>│
```

1. **Sponsor** selects tree species, quantity, region, and payment method (XLM or USDC).
2. **Smart contract** holds funds in escrow, mints a unique Tree NFT ID.
3. **Planter** receives the job, plants the tree, and uploads timestamped photo + GPS proof.
4. **Contract** releases payment to planter upon verification.
5. **Sponsor dashboard** shows live tree progress, species info, and CO₂ offset estimate.

## Carbon Offset Methodology

Harvesta uses published biomass growth tables (FAO / IPCC Tier 1) to estimate CO₂ sequestration per tree species per year. Estimates are clearly labelled as projections and updated annually.

Example:

| Species | Avg CO₂/year (kg) | Maturity |
|---|---|---|
| Teak | 22 kg | 20 years |
| Moringa | 9 kg | 3 years |
| Eucalyptus | 31 kg | 10 years |
| Mangrove | 14 kg | 15 years |
